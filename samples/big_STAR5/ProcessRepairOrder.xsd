		<xsd:annotation>
			<xsd:documentation source="http://www.openapplications.org/oagis/9.0">The Get verb is to communicate to a business software component a request for an existing piece of information to be returned. The Get may be paired with most of the nouns defined in the OAGIS specification.The response to this request is the Show verb. The behavior of a BOD with a Get verb is quite predictable across most of the nouns it may be paired with.The Get is designed to retrieve a single piece of information by using that information's primary retrieval field, or key field. The Get verb is not used to request several documents at once. The GetList verb is designed to achieve that purpose and will be covered in more detail later.Selection Criteria:There are two types of selection capabilities for most BOD's that use the Get verb.1) The first selection capability is called Field-Based Selection. Within a Get-based Business Object Document, the first Data Type that occurs in a specific BOD structure is commonly used to provide the Field-Based Selection criteria. This is always defined within the specific BOD and is commonly the required fields for that specific Data type.The Field-Based Selection enables the requester to provide a value or values (in the case of multiple required Field Identifiers), in the required fields. Then the responding component uses those values to find and return the requested information to the originating business software component.2) The second type of selection capability for Get-based BODs is called Data Type Selection. Data Type selection enables the requester to identify which Data Types within the noun are requested to be returned in the response. The use of this capability is described for each corresponding Data Type for all BODs that use the Get verb. The Data Types are identified for retrieval within the Get instance of a BOD by including the name of the Data Type in the meta data but without any Field Identifiers or Segments identified within the Data Type. This will signify to the responding application that all of the data that corresponds to that Data Type is to be included in the response.If the Data Type is not requested, the Data Type identifier is not included in the Get request and this will signify to the responding component that the Data Type is not to be returned.</xsd:documentation>

Generally this verb is used when maintenance to the document will then pass to the receiving application permanently. An example of this is Load Payable or Load Receivable, where once the request is processed, the sending application has no direct control over the document or entity again.</xsd:documentation>

An example is Post JOURNAL, where information is posted to a general ledger set of financial records. The business use of the word is used instead of the data processing term for the sake of clarity.</xsd:documentation>

In a typical external exchange scenario a Process BOD is considered to be a legally binding message. For example, if a customer sends a ProcessPurchaseOrder BOD to a supplier and the supplier acknowledges with a positive AcknowledgePurchaseOrder, then the customer is obligated to fulfill the agreement, unless of course other BODs are allowed to cancel or change the original order.</xsd:documentation>

This is to be used when the receiver of the SyncBOD does not own the data. This verb is commonly used when mass changes are necessary or when a publish and subscribe mechanism is used in the integration architecture.The purposes of this verb include application integrity and ease of data entry for the business user by enabling a single point of input.</xsd:documentation>

		<xsd:annotation>
			<xsd:documentation source="http://www.openapplications.org/oagis/9.0">In an effort to simpilify the usage of the verbs the GetList verb is being depricated as of OAGIS 9.0, the GetList will still be provided for the next three releases at which time it is scheduled to be removed from OAGIS. As such for all new development we recommend that you use the Get verb which may serve the same function of the GetList verb has in the past. The purpose of the GetList verb is to enable a business software component to request summary information for one or more occurrences of a specific noun from another business software component. The GetList may be paired with most of the nouns in the OAGIS specification.The response to this request is a BOD using the List verb. The GetList is designed to retrieve multiple occurrences of data such as all of the sales orders or all of the purchase orders within a requested range. It does not require an exact match of the key fields in order to retrieve information. It may use a range selection criteria with a "from" and "to" selection capability. This behavior is quite different from the Get verb, which is designed to retrieve a specific noun using a specific key field.The GetList verb also enables the retrieval of information across several documents by using selection fields. An example of this could be requesting all sales order lines for a specific item. This type of functionality is limited to the capabilities of the responding application and needs to be determined during the implementation project. More details on this capability will be described below. GetList attributes: o maxitems attribute is a number that indicates the number of maximum items to be returned. o rssave attribute is a Boolean flag that indicates whether the result set should be saved on the sending system if maxitems is exceeded. o rsstart attribute is a number of the starting record for the next section of the result set. If it is omitted, it is to be assumed the first of the maxitems. o rsref attribute is a string that represents the implementation-specific result set identifier for subsequent requests. Selection Criteria: There are two types of selection capabilities enabled by the BODs that use the GetList verb. 1) Field-Based Selection Allows the requesting system to ask for information that matches the data provided. It also allows the requestor to indicate the information that to be returned by specifying the ReturnCriteria indicated on the GetList Verb. 2) Range Selection Allows the requesting system to provide a range of values for known data. This is accomplished by providing two occurances of the Noun. The first occurance indicates the "From" the second occurance indicates the "To" occurance. Again the requestor can indicate the information that to be returned by specifying the ReturnCriteria indicated on the GetList Verb.</xsd:documentation>

As such for all new development we recommend that you use the Show verb which may serve the same function of the List verb has in the past. The purpose of the List verb is to enable a business software component to respond to a GetList request or to proactively send a listing of summary information containing many instances of occurrences of data for a noun to one or more other business software components.The results of a List may then be used as is, or they may be used to select a specific instance of a document or entity in order to issue a detail Get request.Although BODs based on this verb do not commonly cause updates to occur, there may be times when the component receiving the List decides to use the information it receives to update. This is entirely the decision of the receiving software component and is not forbidden.The behavior of the List verb is quite straight forward with a few exceptions. The List response to any GetList request needs to read the request carefully to ensure the response is returning the requested Data Types. The List needs to ensure the response to the GetList does not exceed the maxItems value.The List needs to find the specific Field Identifiers that are used for the Field-Based Selection or Range-Based Selection and process them accordingly. The attributes associated with the List BODs are as follows: o rsstart attribute is a number that idicates the starting record for the section of the resulting set returned in the list message. This value should always match the rsstart value in the originating GetList BOD. o rscount attribute is a number that indicates the number of records returned in the message. The subsequent request for additional records should have a rsstart value of rscount + 1. o rstotal attribute is a number that indicates the total number of records in the result set. o rscomplete attribute is a Boolean that indicates that the list provided exhaust the possible values. o rsref attribute is a string that represents the implementation-specific result set identifier for subsequent requests.</xsd:documentation>

As such for all new development we recommend that you use the Process verb which may serve the same function of the Create verb has in the past. The Create verb is used to describe specific processing in a more fine grained manner beyond add, change or delete processing. This is generally used when the processing is initiating the building of a document, rather than moving a document from one system to another. Examples of this include Create PRODORDER and Create BOM. In these cases, the documents have not been constructed and need to be. This differs from the Add PO or Add REQUISITN processing as those requests refer to a document that has already been established and the document is being communicated to another business application.</xsd:documentation>

							<xsd:documentation>ResponseCriteria identifies the content that is returned, given a Get query success or the response from the Process. In essence, the expression here has the effect of filtering the part(s) of the found element(s) that are to be returned. ReturnCriteria plays no role in the query itself or the process. That is handled as a match against the request BOD's noun exemplar. ReturnCriteria allows the sender of the BOD to indicate which information (down to the field level) is requested to be returned, given that the query has been successful in matching the exemplar to existing nouns. That is, in a GetListPurchaseOrder, if one or more PurchaseOrders with a TotalPrice = $1M were found, ReturnCriteria tells the BOD recipient which parts of the PurchaseOrder should be populated with content when the response (ShowPurchaseOrder) is formulated. The expressionLanguage indicates the expression language being used. In order for the ReturnCriteria expression to be evaluable by the BOD recipient, the recipient must be capable of processing and interpreting the specified expression language. XPath is the default, due to its ubiquity among XML processing technologies.</xsd:documentation>
